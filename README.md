# Face Recognition and Liveness Detection System

## Overview

This project is an integrated identity verification system using AI technologies that:

- Detects spoofing attempts (fake photos/videos) to ensure the presented face is live and real.
- Verifies identity using DeepFace by comparing with registered face images.
- Allows employee registration with photo capture and storage.
- Provides a simple web interface to interact with the camera and display verification results.

The system uses Flask as a web server, OpenCV for image/video processing, and DeepFace for face recognition.

## Features

- Liveness detection through eye blink and head movement analysis.
- Spoofing detection to reject fake faces (printed photos, videos).
- Face recognition against stored employee images.
- Logs verification results in CSV files.
- Add new employees with live photo capture via the web interface.
- Real-time video streaming and verification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Python libraries:
  - Flask
  - OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
  - DeepFace
  - dlib
  - scipy
  - numpy
- `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file for dlib face landmark detection  
  (Download from [dlib's official site](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2))
- Webcam connected to your system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask opencv-python deepface dlib scipy numpy

## Setup Instructions

1. Download the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file and place it in the project directory.

2. Connect and test your webcam.

## How It Works

The app captures a live video feed from your webcam.

1. **Liveness Detection**:  
    - Detects facial landmarks (e.g., eyes, mouth) to analyze blinking and head movements.  
    - These cues verify liveness, preventing spoofing attacks (e.g., photos or videos).

2. **Face Recognition**:  
    - If liveness is confirmed, the app uses DeepFace to perform face recognition.  
    - Matches the live face against stored employee images.

3. **Results and Logging**:  
    - Displays verification results (success/failure) in the browser interface.  
    - Logs all verification attempts in `.csv` files for record-keeping and auditing.

## Notes

- Use in well-lit environments for optimal accuracy.
- A high-resolution webcam improves face detection and verification quality.
- A GPU is recommended to significantly speed up face recognition via DeepFace.
- You can adjust spoof detection threshold values in the code (`app.py`) for better performance.

## Known Issues

- Low-light conditions reduce facial landmark detection accuracy.
- Performance may be slow on machines without a GPU.
- The application requires the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file. Without it, the app will not run.
