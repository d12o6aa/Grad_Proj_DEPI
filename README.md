# Advanced Facial Recognition System with Anti-Spoofing

## Project Overview

The Advanced Facial Recognition System with Anti-Spoofing aims to develop a secure and efficient system capable of identifying and authenticating individuals while detecting spoofing attempts (e.g., photos, videos, masks). This system will be valuable for applications in security, access control, and fraud prevention.

## Milestone 1: Data Collection, Exploration, and Preprocessing

### Objective:

Collect and preprocess high-quality facial data, including real and spoofed images, for model training.

### Tasks:

#### Data Collection:

- Obtain a labeled dataset containing both real faces and spoofing attempts.
- Utilize **VGGFace2** from Kaggle: [VGGFace2 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hearfool/vggface2/data)
- Ensure diversity in age, ethnicity, lighting conditions, and facial expressions.

#### Data Exploration:

- Analyze data distribution, quality, and potential biases.
- Identify common spoofing techniques such as printed photos, digital screen displays, and masks.

#### Data Preprocessing:

- Resize images (e.g., 224x224 pixels for FaceNet or MobileFaceNet).
- Normalize pixel values and apply color conversion if necessary.
- Apply face detection (e.g., MTCNN, OpenCV) to crop faces.
- Augment data (e.g., rotation, flipping, illumination changes) to improve model generalization.

#### Code Example:

```python
from kagglehub import dataset_download

# Download the VGGFace2 dataset from Kaggle
dataset_download("hearfool/vggface2")
```

### Deliverables:

- **Dataset Report:** Analysis of dataset composition and biases.
- **Preprocessed Data:** Cleaned and transformed dataset ready for training.

## Milestone 2: Model Development and Training

### Objective:

Develop a deep learning model for facial recognition and anti-spoofing detection.

### Tasks:

#### Model Selection:

- Choose models for facial recognition:
  - FaceNet
  - VGG-Face
  - ResNet-based models
- Choose models for anti-spoofing detection:
  - CNN-based classifiers (e.g., Xception, EfficientNet)
  - Hybrid models (e.g., combining frequency-based and deep learning approaches)
  - **DeepFace** for anti-spoofing detection

#### Model Training:

- Use transfer learning to fine-tune models on the collected dataset.
- Train separate models for facial recognition and anti-spoofing, or integrate them into a single pipeline.
- Utilize **DeepFace's anti-spoofing capabilities** to enhance spoof detection.

#### Code Example:

```python
from deepface import DeepFace

# Perform anti-spoofing analysis
analysis = DeepFace.analyze(img_path="test_image.jpg", actions=['spoof'])
print(analysis)
```

#### Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate models using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - False Acceptance Rate (FAR) & False Rejection Rate (FRR)
  - Spoof detection metrics (e.g., Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate - APCER)

#### Model Optimization:

- Balance accuracy and speed for real-time performance.
- Implement lightweight models for deployment on edge devices.

### Deliverables:

- **Model Evaluation Report:** Performance comparison and optimization results.
- **Trained Models:** Finalized facial recognition and anti-spoofing models.
